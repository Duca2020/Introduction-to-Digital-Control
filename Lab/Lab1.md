# DC motor control

On the first lab we are asked a few questions introducing the student to the digital world of devices, once one is accquainted to the basic concepts then it's time to work.

## The DC governor

As was my highest ambition, to touch and manipulate a classical Maxwell's governor didn't come to happen, unfortunately I denied myself to work on a for-educational-purposes prototype, it would be a good presentation to the mechanics of
engines as well as basic principles underlying Control Theory, but it's never too late to start something new, soooo, who knows what tomorrow will bring us?

Anyway, on the lab we do have a prototype of a dc machine through which we should apply a dc voltage to obtain a desired velocity. As simple as it may seem at first, don't forget we are here to find ways of implementing the best
algorithms capable of a proper/regulated control, and here enters digital control.

After a few experimentations with different values of power modulation, we are able to wisely judge our action and devise a plan to obtain parameters such as DC gain, time constant, settling time, overshoot and error. Under God's supervision
I'm not alone on this journey, a noble accompanies me at my right side, sharing his experience and expertise on the matter, not to mention how used he is to certains behaviours I couldn't predict from Matlab.

All in all, this first lab isn't a big trouble, and indeed it wasn't intend to, my view is of a introduction where we can bridge some concepts and formulas from the 'analog' control theory, but even that can be time consuming, don't make me start 
talking about how data analysis can be so stressing...
